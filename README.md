This is where I keep my softwares, and tools and scrap code to make sure things at least work before I start adding things to the sidbox firmware.

Added tools to help me do things and test
- SIDBOX TERMINAL:
  This allows me to communicate directly to the sidbox, it's a little bit like terminal, since the sidbox internally sends commands to this, giving it an almost perfect commandline system.
  The sidbox terminal still under development with the more things I need to test. I'll add its function here.
  This uses QT6, and is being coded in the Linux FEDORA KDE environment (the source code should still compile in windows, tested and it does with minor tweaks)
  
- the HID stuff is mainly trying to get the USB data packets to be sent directly though to the sidbox, but this is causing more issues, and they DON'T WORK!
